# I might start a blog to document some projects (and rant sometimes, of course!)

Occasionally have something I'd write a few words on, even if only to document for myself, but never got to setting it up (want to self-host, github is only a copy of my private repo running on Gitea). So no wordpress or static site generator, but just markdown. I got the idea from [Stefan Eissing](https://github.com/icing)

So we'll see where this leads and if I can actually be bothered to write something
